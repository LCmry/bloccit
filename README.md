## Bloccit:  a Reddit clone to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails 4.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

### Configuration

#### Setting environmental variables
 Use `application.example.yml` in /config/ to make an `application.yml` file and fill in the credentials and key.  Don't forget to add the `application.yml` file to .gitignore.
